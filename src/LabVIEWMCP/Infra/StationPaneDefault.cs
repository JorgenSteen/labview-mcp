/// Which connector pane pattern a NEWLY created VI gets on this station - read out of
/// <c>LabVIEW.ini</c>, key <c>DefaultConPane</c>.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a correction. This repository twice wrote down a fixed conIdx map for
/// generated VIs, and twice it was wrong on a machine other than the one it was measured on. The
/// second time cost a rejected VI. Both write-ups reasoned that the AIXML generator "chooses" the
/// pattern and that the choice could not be predicted - one of them measured index sets against
/// patterns trying to find the rule.
///
/// There is no rule to find: the generator does not choose at all. LabVIEW gives every new VI the
/// station's DEFAULT pane, and that default is a setting. `DefaultConPane="4833"` is what this
/// station carries, which is why everything generated here comes out 16-terminal; LabVIEW's factory
/// default is 4815, the 12-terminal 4x2x2x4, which is why the older measurement was right when it
/// was made and wrong later. So the pattern IS knowable in advance - just not from the AIXML, and
/// not from anything inside LabVIEW's API.
///
/// WHAT THIS DOES NOT TELL YOU. Only the pattern of a *new* VI. An existing VI carries whatever pane
/// it was given, possibly rotated or flipped, so <c>lvai_connector_pane</c> still measures rather
/// than assumes - see <see cref="ConnectorPanePatterns"/> on orientations. And a setting can change
/// under you: an edited ini, a different machine, a colleague's station. That is an argument for
/// reading it each time, which is what this does, not for writing the number down again.
///
/// READ-ONLY, AND THAT IS A RULE RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT. There is no write path here and none is to
/// be added: the station's owner has ruled out modifying <c>LabVIEW.ini</c>. It is tempting for one
/// specific job - setting <c>DefaultConPane</c> would let the four unmeasured patterns be observed on
/// a throwaway VI - and that is exactly the temptation being refused. LabVIEW also rewrites the file
/// on exit, so a write would have to be timed around the IDE's lifetime, which makes it worse rather
/// than better. Report what the key says; if it must change, the user changes it.
