# Save version: files for an older LabVIEW

A project kept for an older LabVIEW pins its save version in the `.lvproj`:
`<Property Name="NI.LV.All.SaveVersion" Type="Str">21.0</Property>` (or `Editor version`, which
means "the LabVIEW that saves it"). Two field projects worked that way - one at 21.0 for stations
running LabVIEW 2021, a driver project at 18.0 for LabVIEW 2018 - and both ranked the same gap
first: the tools saved files in the IDE's version, and the target LabVIEW found out only when it
loaded them, on the target PC (`VI version (26.0) is newer`, load error 9, the 21.0 project, 2026-10-30; nine
saving tools wrote 25.0 into 18.0 projects, the driver project).

## 1. What the server does (since 2026-11-13)

**Every tool answer is checked** (`Infra/SaveVersions.cs`, called from `DiagnosingTool`, which every
served tool passes). Before a call, the version and write time of each LabVIEW file its ARGUMENTS
name are read; after it, every LabVIEW file named in the arguments or the ANSWER that was written
during the call is read again - a file named before the call counts as written only when its write
time changed (since 2026-11-13: with the 2 s margin alone, a call made within 2 s of an icon save
was blamed for it), any other one when it was written after the call started, less 2 s. A file now saved newer than it was before, or newer than the version its project
pins, is reported:

```json
"saveVersionCheck": {
  "files": [ { "path": "...\\AddTwo.vi", "savedAs": "26.0", "was": "20.0",
               "projectSaveVersion": "20.0", "project": "...\\P20.lvproj" } ],
  "warning": "1 file(s) were saved by this call in a NEWER LabVIEW version than they had, ..."
}
```

Nothing is refused or undone there - the file is already written; the answer says so while it can
still be restored. An answer with nothing to report is not touched. The versions come from the
FILES, no LabVIEW: a resource file's `LVSR` block starts with the version word (`26008000` = 26.0,
`20008000` = 20.0, measured on files LabVIEW 2026 and 2020 wrote); an XML file carries it as the root
element's `LVVersion`. The pin that applies is the one of a project that lists the file, or lists the
library or class that owns it (`pinFrom: "listed"`); for a file no project lists yet, the composer's
folder rule below (`pinFrom: "folder"` - measured 2026-11-13: a new VI given its icon before it was
listed was reported with no pin at all). Files are recognised by extension (`.vi .ctl .vim .vit .ctt .lvclass
.lvlib .lvproj`); a call naming more than 300 is not checked.

**The composer writes the pinned version** (`AixmlComposer.PinnedTarget`), on the pylabview backend:
a VI a project lists takes that project's pin; a NEW VI takes the pin every project in its folder
and up to three folders above agrees on. The composer writes files for LabVIEW 2020 and later only,
so an older pin (18.0) is reported in `versionWarning` and the file is written in the newest version
it would otherwise use.

**`lvai_generate_vi` skips the steps that save through LabVIEW** for a VI older than the running
LabVIEW: the constant tidy, the panel and diagram clean-up and the icon each SAVE, and would
rewrite the file in the running LabVIEW's version. The answer has a `savingStepsSkipped` step and
says so in `note`; the diagram is then the composer's own layout. The size measurement still runs
(a render saves nothing).

**`lvai_describe_project`** answers `saveVersion` (the pin, or `Editor version`) and
`projectFileSavedBy` (the LabVIEW that last saved the `.lvproj`).

## 2. Measured 2026-11-13

A project pinned to `20.0`, LabVIEW 2026 Q3 running, pylabview backend, a branch build over raw
stdio (`mcp_temp`, not committed):

| step | result |
|---|---|
| `lvai_describe_project` | `saveVersion: "20.0"`, `projectFileSavedBy: "20.0"` |
| `lvai_generate_vi` of two VIs the project lists | both written as LabVIEW 20.0 files, `executable: true` in LabVIEW 2026, `savingStepsSkipped` |
| `lvai_run_vi_and_read_values` in LabVIEW 2026 | 2.5 + 40 = 42.5 |
| `lvai_set_vi_icon` on one of them | saved by LabVIEW 2026 as 26.0; `saveVersionCheck`: `was 20.0`, `savedAs 26.0`, `projectSaveVersion 20.0` |
| LabVIEW 2020: the other VI | `execState 1`, ran 42.5 |
| LabVIEW 2020: the one the icon tool re-saved | the reference never opened |

## 3. A project close in a newer LabVIEW rewrites the `.lvproj` (measured 2026-11-13)

A field project pinned to 21.0 and kept for LabVIEW 2021 **64-bit** was opened in LabVIEW 2026 Q3
**32-bit**: the Project Explorer showed it changed (`*`) at once, with nothing edited.
`lvai_restart_labview`'s close saved it (every project close saves - the helper runs Save, then
Close, because an unsaved close would raise a modal prompt). The pin and `LVVersion` stayed 21.0, so
`saveVersionCheck` had nothing to report - and the file was 154 402 -> 100 287 bytes:

- Dependencies emptied: 392 entries (374 VI, 9 Library, 7 Document) -> none. LabVIEW lists them
  again when it loads the VIs.
- Every installer specification: `DistPart[n]` "NI LabVIEW Runtime 2021 SP1 f6 (64-bit)" (with its
  productID) -> "NI LabVIEW Run-Time Engine 2021" with EMPTY productID and flavorID;
  `InstSpecBitness` 64-bit -> 32-bit; `InstSpecVersion` 21018002 -> 21000000. An installer built from
  that project is no longer the one it was.

**Since then every project close reports it** (`Infra/ProjectRewrite.cs`, called by
`lvai_close_active_project` and so by every tool that closes a project, `lvai_restart_labview`
included): the `.lvproj` is copied before the close, compared after LabVIEW's save and BEFORE the
stray sweep, and the answer carries `projectRewrite` - `changed`, `bytes`, `lvVersion` and
`saveVersion` before/after, `dependencies` before/after, `items.removed`/`added` (tree paths outside
Dependencies and Build Specifications), `buildSpecifications.changedProperties` (spec, property,
before, after), `otherPropertiesChanged`, `backupPath` and a `warning` that the close's `note` and
the restart's side-effect line repeat. The copy lives under the cache root
(`project-backups\<name>.<time>.lvproj`, newest 50 kept), never beside the project. Putting it back
is the caller's decision, with the project closed: a save that carries this session's own project
edits must stay. Closing WITHOUT saving was not attempted - it needs a probe of what `Close` does on
an unsaved project (a modal prompt stops every call).

## 4. Not done, and why

- **Saving through LabVIEW in an older version.** The tools that save through LabVIEW (layout,
  icons, swaps, typedef binds, class tools) still write the running LabVIEW's version; the check
  reports it. A save through the project that pins the version is what LabVIEW itself honours (the
  driver project saw `lvai_bind_typedef_constants`, which saves with the project active, write 18.0),
  but opening the project for it clashes with the rule that no tool opens or closes a project while
  agents work in parallel, and a newer LabVIEW closing an older project rewrites the `.lvproj`
  (measured in the 21.0 project). Not attempted.
- **NI's converter** (`backend: grpc`) writes the running LabVIEW's version; only the composer takes
  a target version.
- **`.lvversion` files** and a library's or class's own save version are not read: not measured here.
